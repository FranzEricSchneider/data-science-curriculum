# Intuitive Definition
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Imagine we have some set of events $X$, and we're considering some *particular* subset of cases that we're interested in $A$. For instance, imagine we're rolling a 6-sided die, and we're interested in cases when the number rolled is even. Then the subset of cases is $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$, and an *example run* of rolls might be $X = \{3, 5, 5, 2, 6, 1, 3, 3\}$.

The *frequency* with which events in $A$ occurred for a run $X$ is

$$F_X(A) \equiv \sum \frac{\text{Cases in set }A}{\text{Total Cases in }X}.$$

For the example above, we have

$$\begin{aligned} 
  A &= \{2, 4, 6\}, \\ 
  X &= \{3, 5, 5, \mathbf{2}, \mathbf{6}, 1, 3, 3\}, \\
  F_X(A) &= \frac{2}{8} = 1/4
  \end{aligned}$$
