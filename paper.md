# Summary

This work provides an open-source, active learning curriculum for teaching and self-study of data science.

[@grolemund2018r]

## Statement of Need

(How this enables computationally-enabled teaching and learning)

(How they might be adopted by others)

## Pedagogical Design

(learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of use)

The full set of desired learning outcomes is documented in the [project repository](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/blob/master/curriculum.md) but at a high level, the learning goals of this content is for students to develop:

1. The ability to set up and maintain a scientifically reproducible data science workflow,
2. The skills and self-efficacy to access, clean, and tidy data,
3. The skills to visualize data, both for for exploration and communication,
4. The mindset to think and interpret statistically, and
5. The skills and understanding to fit and interpret data-driven models.

The content

## Inspiration and Dependencies

The exercises make heavy use of the `Tidyverse` [@wickham2019tidyverse] "metapackage", as well as other R packages [].
