# Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to...

## (Data)

Core
- (Isolate)
  - data using `filter`
  - variables using `select`
- (Derive)
  - new variables with `mutate`
  - summaries with `group_by` and `summarize`
  - string matches with regular expressions
- (Tidy)
  - by reshaping with `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`
  - by `separate` and `unite` of columns
  - by `join` of multiple tables
- (Load)
  - data from a flat file (e.g. .csv)
  - data from googlesheets
  - data messy data (e.g. a nasty excel file)

Bonus
- (Derive)
  - (window functions)
- (Specialty)
  - (lubridate)
  - (stringr)
  - (forcats)

## (Visualization)

Core
- State the basic components of the *grammar of graphics*: geometry, aesthetics,
  theme, layers
- (Create)
  - bar charts
  - histograms
  - boxplots
  - scatterplots
  - line plots
  - EDA-quality graphics
  - presentation-ready graphics
- (Criticize)
  - data visualizations based on *the visual hierarchy*
  - data visualizations based on their intended audience

Bonus
- (Geospatial with sf)

## (Statistical Literacy)

Core
- (Describe)
  - the difference between variability and uncertainty
  - the difference between error and uncertainty
  - a random quantity with a distribution
  - a dataset with descriptive statistics (mean, quantiles, correlations)
  - the relationship between variables using a model
  - a future outcome using a fitted model
- (Quantify)
  - the degree of uncertainty (in an estimate, a prediction)
  - testing and training (e.g. via cross-validation)
- (Fit)
  - a distribution
  - a linear model
- (Question)
  - whether a given numerical result relates to a qualitative conclusion
  - whether a given degree of certainty is sufficient to make a decision
  - whether a given study has sufficient relevance to a given question

Bonus
- (Fit)
  - a gaussian process
  - a random forest
- (Select)
  - features based on an appropriate error estimate
  - hyperparameters based on an appropriate error estimate

*** (Communication)
- Write easily-readable code by following a styleguide
- Tell a story using the ABT framework
- Judge a data story using the ABT framework

## (Reproducibility)

Core
-

Bonus
- (Git)
- (Command line)
- (File hygiene)
- (Directory structuring)
