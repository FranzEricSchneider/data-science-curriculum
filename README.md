# data-science-curriculum

This is a curriculum of **open-source** data science exercises, intended to take a student from zero coding experience to basic data science literacy. These exercises are heavily inspired by the (discontinued) [Data Challenge Lab](https://dcl-docs.stanford.edu/home/) at Stanford University and rely on the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

## Course Description

Data Science is a powerful toolkit to extract usable insights from data. In this class, you will learn tools and gain understanding. You will use software tools to *liberate* data from published images and tables, wrangle messy datasets into machine learning (ML)-ready form, fit and interpret ML models, and visualize to extract meaning. You will also speak the language of uncertainty---statistics---to avoid getting fooled by models. You will criticize published findings and ask what is, and what is not, in the data. Assignments will include regular practice exercises, progressively puzzling real-data challenges, and a final project of your choice where you obtain, wrangle, and understand a dataset.
